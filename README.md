# Todo list Application
## Objective
I am planning to build a simple to-do list application using Django. The application will allow users to:

1. Add new tasks.
2. View a list of tasks.

### Backend Development (Django)

I will set up a Django project with a single model:
- **Task**: Fields: Title (Text).

I will implement functionality for:
- Adding tasks.
- Viewing a list of tasks.

### Frontend (HTML/CSS)

I will use basic HTML and CSS to create:
- A form to add tasks.
- A list view displaying tasks.

### GitHub

I will push my code to a public GitHub repository with:
- A clear commit history.
- A README file explaining how to set up and run the project.

## Usage

Instructions on how to set up and run the project will be updated here once the implementation is complete.
